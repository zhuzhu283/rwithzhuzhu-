    <p>The closest hospital to the sober house was Saint John’s. Since Erin had had the foresight to call ahead 
        and <span class="tooltip">alert<span class="tooltiptext">警示，提醒v.&adj.&n.</span></span> 
        them that a VIP was <span class="tooltip">en route<span class="tooltiptext">在路上，英语里面有非常多化用法语的情况，诺曼底征服对英语语言的影响非常大</span></span>, 
        someone met us at the emergency <span class="tooltip">valet<span class="tooltiptext">紧急停车位</span></span>. Not knowing at the time how crazy sick I was when she made the call, Erin had been concerned about my privacy. But the folks at the hospital could see something was seriously wrong and rushed me to a treatment room. There, I was heard to say, “Erin, why are there Ping-Pong balls on the couch?”
    </p>
    <p>There was no couch, and there were no Ping-Pong balls—I was just completely <span class="tooltip">delusional<span class="tooltiptext">妄想的</span></span>. (I wasn’t aware that pain could make you <span class="tooltip">delusional<span class="tooltiptext">妄想的</span></span>, but there ya go.) Then the Dilaudid (my personal favorite drug in the whole wide world) hit my brain, and I brieﬂy regained consciousness.</p>
    <p>I was told I needed surgery immediately, and suddenly, every nurse in California <span class="tooltip">descended<span class="tooltiptext">下降，突然造访；<br>也有传承的意思；<br>de-向下</span></span> upon my room. 
        One of them turned to Erin and said, “Get ready to run!”
         Erin was ready, and we all ran— well, they ran, I was merely wheeled at high speed to a procedure room. 
        Erin was asked to leave mere seconds after I’d said to her “Please don’t leave,” then I closed my eyes, and they wouldn’t open again for two weeks.</p>
    <p>yes, that’s right: a <span class="tooltip">coma<span class="tooltiptext">昏迷</span></span>, 
    ladies and gentlemen! (And those motherfuckers back at the sober living had tried to block the car?)</p>

    <p>The ﬁrst thing that happened when I lapsed into 
        a <span class="tooltip">coma<span class="tooltiptext">昏迷</span></span> was that I <span class="tooltip">aspirated<span class="tooltiptext">吸气<br>同根词aspiration渴望，抱负</span></span> into my breathing tube, 
        <span class="tooltip">vomiting<span class="tooltiptext">呕吐</span></span> ten days’ worth of toxic <span class="tooltip">shit<span class="tooltiptext">有毒的物质</span></span> 
        directly into my lungs. My lungs didn’t like that very much—enter instant <span class="tooltip">pneumonia<span class="tooltiptext">肺部感染</span></span>
        —and that is when my <span class="tooltip">colon<span class="tooltiptext">结肠</span></span> exploded. Let me repeat for those in the back: my <span class="tooltip">colon<span class="tooltiptext">结肠</span></span> exploded! 
        I’ve been accused of being full of <span class="tooltip">shit<span class="tooltiptext">好恶心的玩笑，有人骂Matty满嘴脏话，结肠爆炸之后他是真的“喷粪”了</span></span> before, 
        but this time I really was.</p>
    <p>I’m glad I wasn’t there for that.</p>


     <P>It was almost certain at that point that I was going to die. 
        Was I unlucky that my <span class="tooltip">colon<span class="tooltiptext">结肠</span></span> exploded?
         Or was I lucky that it happened in the one room in Southern California where they could do something about it? Either way, 
         I now faced a seven-hour surgery, which at least gave all my loved ones ample（abundant、sufficient、competent、full、plenty 
         time to race to the hospital. As they arrived they were each told, “Matthew has a two percent chance of making it through the night.”</P>

   <p><P>Everyone was so <span class="tooltip">wrought with emotion<span class="tooltiptext">wrought本义为adj.锻造的；<br>是work的古过去分词，即“被工作过的”引申成“锻造的”义；<br>wrought with充满，这里指每个人都很激动</span></span> that some <span class="tooltip">crumbled<span class="tooltiptext">坍塌，碎裂<br>词源crumb，面包屑</span></span> to the ground right there in the hospital lobby. 
    I will have to live out the rest of my days knowing that my mother and others heard those words.</P>

    <P>With me in surgery for at least seven hours and convinced that the hospital would do everything they could,
         my family and friends went home for the night for some rest while my subconscious fought for my life <span class="tooltip">amid<span class="tooltiptext">四周是，环绕，词义类似于among</span></span> the knives 
         and tubes and blood.
    </P>
         

     <P> <span class="tooltip">Spoiler alert:<span class="tooltiptext">剧透警告：评论员在即将透露剧情细节之前发出的警告</span></span>
            I did make it through the night. 
        But I wasn’t out of the woods yet. 
        My family and friends were told that the only thing that could keep me alive short-term was an ECMO machine (ECMO stands for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation)（体外膜肺）. 
        The ECMO move is often called a <span class="tooltip">Hail Mary<span class="tooltiptext">一个比喻表达，源自美式足球术语。在美式足球中，"Hail Mary"指的是在比赛的最后时刻，落后的队伍会尝试一次高风险的长传，希望接球手能接住并得分。这种传球通常成功的机会非常小，但如果没有其他选择，队伍可能会尝试这种策略。<br>在医学领域，"Hail Mary"被用来比喻那些在病人生命垂危时采取的最后手段或极端措施</span></span>
        —for a start, four patients that week at UCLA had been put on ECMO, 
        and they all died.</P>
     <p>Making things even tougher, Saint John’s didn’t have an ECMO machine. 
        Cedars-Sinai was called—they took one look at my chart and apparently said, 
        “Matthew Perry is not dying in our hospital.” </p>
        <p>Thanks guys.</p>

     <p>UCLA wasn’t willing to take me, either—for the same reason? 
        Who can say?—but at least they were willing to send an ECMO machine and a team. 
        I was hooked up to it for several hours, 
        and it seemed to work! I was then transferred to UCLA itself,
         in an ambulance ﬁlled with doctors and nurses. 
         (There was no way I’d survive a ﬁfteen-minute car ride, especially the way Erin drives.)</p>
     <p> At UCLA I was taken to the heart and lung ICU unit; 
        it would become my home for the next six weeks. 
        I was still in a <span class="tooltip">coma<span class="tooltiptext">昏迷</span></span>, but honestly, 
        I probably loved it. I was lying down, all <span class="tooltip">snuggled up<span class="tooltiptext">舒舒服服躺着</span></span>, 
        and they were <span class="tooltip">pumping<span class="tooltiptext">泵，注射</span></span>drugs into me—what’s better than that? </p >
       
     <p>I’m told that during my coma I was never left alone, not once— there was always a member of my family or a friend in the room with me. 
        They held <span class="tooltip">candlelight vigils<span class="tooltiptext">守夜candle-light非常有画面感，抱着烛光</span></span>;
         did prayer circles. Love was all around me.
     </p>
     <p>
        Eventually, my eyes magically opened. [Back to the memoir.（以上昏迷期间，都是别人记录的）] The ﬁrst thing I saw was my mother.</p>

        
        <p>“What’s going on?” I managed to croak. “Where the hell am I?” The last thing I remembered was being in a car with Erin. “Your colon exploded,” Mom said.</p>
        
       <p> With that information, I did what any comic actor（喜剧演员）might do: I rolled my eyes and went back to sleep.</p>
